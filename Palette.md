## Texts conventions

#### Font family

The font family to be used for titles and buttons shall be **Annie Use Your Telescope**, whose file can be found under the path `Design/annie_use_your_telescope/AnnieUseYourTelescope.ttf`.

#### Texts color

Preferably, the text will be **white** with a colored background behind it (e.g. in buttons, panels, etc.) except error or warning cases, when red and yellow colors can be used.

If a simple text without button or panel is needed, a shadow will be used behind the text in order to provide depth over the UI.
